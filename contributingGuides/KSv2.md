In Expensify we have an engineering prioritization process called "Kernel Scheduler v2" (KSv2). This system prioritizes tasks based on time priorities:

**Hourly**: If a Github issue has the `Hourly` label, the assignee should update it *at least* once an hour

**Daily**: If a Github issue has the `Daily` label, the assignee should update it *at least* once a day

**Weekly**: If a Github issue has the `Weekly` label, the assignee should update it *at least* once a week

**Monthly**: If a Github issue has the `Monthly` label, the assignee should update it *at least* once a month.

If a GitHub issue has the `Overdue` label, it means that it hasn't been updated in the amount of time allotted for an update (ex - A weekly issue becomes overdue if it hasn't been updated in a week).

You can install the KSv2 extension from [here](https://github.com/Expensify/k2-extension/). As a best practice, before you start working on things, go to the [K2 dashboard](https://github.com/Expensify/Expensify#k2). At the top of the page, it lists all your assigned issues and anything with red text is overdue. Take time to address each overdue issue. That's it!
